      <h2>About Me - A Cybersecurity Researcher, Husband to a PhD, and Father of a Toddler</h2>
        <section class="intro">
            <p>Hello! I‚Äôm Hanqing Guo, a passionate cybersecurity researcher dedicated to exploring the intersection of wireless systems and security. While I‚Äôm deeply immersed in my academic and professional pursuits, I‚Äôm also a husband supporting my wife‚Äôs PhD journey and a father raising a curious toddler. My story is one of balancing career ambitions with the joys and challenges of family life.</p>

            <h2>My Academic Journey</h2>
            <p>My academic journey began in 2017 when I enrolled in the MS program at Ball State University (BSU) advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oR6tS5AAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Shaoen Wu</a>. From January 2017 to August 2019, I immersed myself in combining deep learning with wireless communication and sensing systems.</p> 
            <p>In <strong>August 2019</strong>, I took the next step, starting my <strong>PhD in Computer Science</strong> at Michigan State University (MSU). This was not just the beginning of a new academic chapter but also a personal milestone. My wife and I welcomed our first child during the pandemic, making it a hard time as I balanced research with the responsibilities of fatherhood.</p>

            <p>In <strong>August 2024</strong>, I obtained my Phd degree in Computer Science at Michigan State University, much thanks to my advisor <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/~lxiao/">Dr. Li Xiao</a> and <a href="https://cse.msu.edu/~qyan/">Dr. Qiben Yan</a>, for their invaluable guidance and support throughout my journey. After that, I started my new journey at University of Hawaii at Manoa, to continue the cybersecurity research in the field of Wireless Communication, Trustworthy AI, and Mobile Systems.

            <h2>Industry Experience</h2>
            <p>My professional experience complements my academic work. From 2015 to 2017, I worked full-time at <strong>FiberHome Telecommunication</strong>, where I build 4G LTE network in <b>Malaysia</b> and <b>the Philippines</b>, gaining hands-on experience in the fast-paced world of telecommunications. Afterward, I had the opportunity to intern at two major tech giants as <strong>Applied Scientist/Research Scientist</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Samsung Research America</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Amazon</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These internships from 2022 to 2023 helped me further hone my skills in cybersecurity, wireless systems, and real-world applications of advanced technologies.</p>

            <h2>On a Personal Note</h2>
            <p>As a researcher, I strive to push the boundaries of cybersecurity and wireless systems. But beyond the lab, I‚Äôm a husband who understands the value of collaboration, as I‚Äôve supported my wife through her PhD journey. And perhaps my most important role is being a father, learning to balance the demands of academia with the joys and challenges of raising a toddler. These experiences have shaped my perspective, not only as a professional but also as a person.</p>
            <p>I‚Äôm excited to continue this journey and see where the world of technology, family, and research takes me next.</p>
