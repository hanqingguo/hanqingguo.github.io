      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>I am an assistant professor in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering at Michigan State University, US, in 2024, an M.S. in Computer Science from Ball State University (fully funded with Research Assistant Scholarship), US, in 2019, and a B.S. in Communications Engineering from  Chongqing University of Posts of Telecommunications, China, in 2015. Prior to joining the University of Hawai ªi, I was a research scientist at Samsung Research America (Knox security team) and Amazon (ML security team based in San Diego).
        My research interest includes cybersecurity, trustworthy AI, mobile system & sensing. In particular, I am interested in security & privacy problems in real-world AI-enabled applications, such as authentication systems, smart speakers, smart agents, and IoT devices.</p>
